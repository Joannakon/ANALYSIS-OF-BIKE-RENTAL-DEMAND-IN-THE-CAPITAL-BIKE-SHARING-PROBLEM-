Model 1:
Log (count) ~ Intercept + atemp + humidity + temp + windspeed + {workingday 0,1} + {season 1, 2, 3, 4} + {weather 1, 2, 3}
Model 2:
Root square (count) ~ atemp + humidity + windspeed + {workingday 0, 1} + {season 1, 2, 3} + {weather 1, 2}

Model 3: Root square (count) ~ atemp + humidity + windspeed + {workingday 0, 1} + {season 1, 2, 3} + {weather 1, 2} + humidity*humidity
Model 4: Generalized Additive Model

#CrossValidation:
In the K-fold cross validation, we took k=4. Four replicate samples of the data are taken, each one
using 3 replicates to build the model and the remaining one to test the model. In each replicate, the variable selected is an automatic variable generated by proc surveyselect. The model with the smallest PRESS (predicted residual sum of squares) will be given at last. We can calculate the RMSE of this model.
The RMSE of Model1, Model 2 and 3 are respectively 88.0735, 2.81950 and 2.76700. Thus, Model 1 has a large RMSE, while Model 3 has a better result than Model 2 in RMSE which is consistent with the conclusion above. Thus, we chose Model 3 as our final model.

#Prediction
At last, we used the Model 3 to do prediction on the root square count and count based on the dataset combined with train data (456 observations) and test data (45 observations selected, similarly we applied the subset with time 12). The prediction result is listed in the appendix.
